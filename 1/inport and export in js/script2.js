// imagine Node.js as a teamwork between JavaScript and some C++ tricks. They grabbed a bunch of code from Chrome's V8 engine, mixed it with JavaScript, and now we can write JavaScript code that buddies up with the C++ stuff. It's like having a secret code that lets JavaScript and C++ be pals. You write your JavaScript, and Node.js makes sure it plays well with the C++ stuff. Think of it as a dynamic duo setting up a server, but here's the deal: it only works as long as this special code is doing its thing. It's like a quiet magic in the background that lets us do cool things with both languages.

// Node let's you create server. Java Script alone cannot run a server.
